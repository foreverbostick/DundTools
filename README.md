<h1>Welcome to DundTools - A collection of tools to use during Dungeons & Dragons 5e game sessions.</h1>

Very *very* much a work in progress.

I have no previous experience in programming outside of dabbling and following the most basic tutorials. This project is for me to learn Python, so if you're seeing this *please* don't judge me too hard for shitty code.

I 100% open to any advice and constructive criticism. I'm learning all of this as I go, looking up definitions and best practices along the way.


<h5>Modules are classified as follows:</h5>
- working
- work in progress (WIP)
- not started (NS)


<h3>Current Modules:</h3>
- Command line dice roller (diceroll.py -- working)

<h3>Planned Modules:</h3>
- DM Screen
- Map loader
- Notes
- Possibly a GUI? I'm debating on either GTK or TUI


<h3>Character Creator</h3>
- Interactive script to select a player character's race, and add stat modifiers to base stats (race.py -- working)
- Small script to simulate rolling 3d6 for random stat generation (statroll.py -- working)
- Script to combine stat mods from the chosen race and rolls, as well provide +/- mods for skills (WIP)
- Interactive script to select feats (NS)
- Interactive script to select skill proficiencies (NS)


<h3>DM Screen (NS)</h3>
- Common rules/conditions
- Dice roller
- DC reference
- NPC name generator
- Random encounter roller
- Initiative tracker

<h3>Map Loader</h3>
- Load image files to use as maps
- Load image files to use as tokens
This one might be a bit out of my league. What I'm imagining is pretty much a rudimentary VTT, so we'll see what happens when I get to this point.

<h3>Notes</h3>
- Simple note taking app for the DM/PCs to keep track of things. Completely unnecessary, but it'd be nice to not need a separate app.
